## Package Split up

> todo: add what was moved to which package/sub-path after first clean-up of a working demo-web/demo-server setup

## Renamed Code

List of renamed functions, components etc., most are also moved to other packages / paths - and some may be renamed/moved again until final `v0.5.0` release.

- `PluginSimple` > `SchemaPlugin`,
- `PluginSimpleStack` > `SchemaPluginsAdapter`,
- `PluginSimpleStack/handlePluginSimpleStack` > `SchemaPluginStack`
- `schemaToNative/mapSchema` > `schemaRulesToNative`
- `PluginStack` > `WidgetEngine`
- `ComponentPluginType` >`WidgetPluginType`
- `PluginProps` >`WidgetPluginProps`
- `WidgetProps` > `WidgetPayload` AND `WidgetProps`
- `CommonTypings/Errors` > `ValidatorErrorsType`
- `ObjectGroup` > `SchemaLayer`
- `Translate/Trans` > `Translate`
- `Translate/TransTitle` > `TranslateTitle`
- `Translate/relT` > `TranslatorRelative`
- `Translate/relT/relTranslator` > `translateRelative`

## General Changes

### System

- removed function `checkNativeValidity` in `schemaToNative`
- moved react-specific widget matching logic from `widgetMatcher` to `WidgetRenderer`

### React

#### WidgetsBinding

- `pluginStack` to `widgetPlugins`
- `pluginSimpleStack` to `schemaPlugins`
- added `ObjectRenderer` as `type.object` / no longer as hard coded default
- added `NoWidget` as `NoWidget` / no longer as hard coded default
- browser error translation switched from `"t": "browser"` to `"tBy": "browser"`

#### React Plugins

- removed `ExtractStorePlugin`, included now in `WidgetEngine` directly (for the moment, experimenting performance/typing)
- removed `level` property, use `schemaKeys`/`storeKeys` to calc. that when necessary
- removed `WidgetRenderer` from `getNextPlugin` internals, moved to `widgetPlugins` directly

### DS Material

- adjusted root import paths, no longer exports the actual widgets directly - only with sub-folder
- `widgetsBinding` case adjusted to `*W*idgetsBinding`, no longer exports `widgets`
- `WidgetBinding | WidgetsBinding | MuiWidgetsBinding` types, folder and file names normalized to be `WidgetsBinding`
- previous `widgetsBinding.widgets` now exported with multiple modular functions:
    - separate files in `WidgetsDefault`, to be able to only import the ones really used in your app
    - import all: `import * as WidgetsDefault from '@ui-schema/ds-material/WidgetsDefault'`
    - import modular, e.g. `import {define} from '@ui-schema/ds-material/WidgetsDefault/define'`
    - `define(partialBinding)` just generates the basic structure without any plugins or widgets
        - accepts the rest of the binding as parameter
    - `plugins()` returns `schemaPlugins` and `widgetPlugins`
    - `widgetsTypes()` just returns `types` widgets
    - `widgetsCustom()` just returns some recommended `custom` widgets
- `pluginStack` removed, now included directly in `widgetsBinding`

## Todos Misc

- tests
    - `ts-jest` needed `compilerOptions.jsx: "react"`, or not? somehow works in other repos without
        - https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/63
    - typechecks are disabled for tests via `isolatedModules` in `jest.config.ts`
- check all `@mui` import, wrong imports lead to jest failures: "can not use import outside module"
    - never go into the third level, even for "sub bundles" like `/styles`,
      it fails when using `import useTheme from '@mui/material/styles/useTheme'`
      but works using `import { useTheme } from '@mui/material/styles'`
- refactor `widgetMatcher` to `widgets` binding
- clean and fix using `{}` in generic, as it often leads to "is assignable to the constraint of type C, but C could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint {}"
    - easiest, yet very ugly workaround is typing all props like:
        - generics: `<C extends {} = {}, W extends WidgetsBindingFactory = WidgetsBindingFactory, P extends WidgetPluginProps<W> = WidgetPluginProps<W>>`
        - usage: `return <Plugin {...{ currentPluginIndex: next, ...props } as C & P} />`
    - using `object` or `Record<string, unkown>` or `Record<string, any>` does not work
    - find a better solution, especially for the `eslint` rule [@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-empty-object-type/)
    - the generic in `UIStoreProvider` causes no issue in `demo-web`, yet in `WidgetRenderer.test` causes props to be inferred as `never`, causing a lot of type errors
    - cleanup workarounds in:
        - `NextPluginRenderer`
- finalize `package.json` generation for strict esm with ESM and CJS support
- normalize `tsconfig` `moduleResolution`
    - `demo-web`: as `react-immutable-editor` is pure ESM and strict ESM using `exports` with files in a sub-directory,
      the `demo-web` uses no `type: "module"` and `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` to resolve it,
      it also works with `type: "module"` and `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` - except for the remaining `.js` files,
      but the alternative with `type: "module"` and `moduleResolution: "Node16"` breaks other imports of packages not strict-ESM yet
    - `docs`: uses no `type: "module"`, as that breaks older dependencies, instead TS config contains `"module": "CommonJS", "moduleResolution": "node"`
      to support any older standards in CLI and webpack bundle, even while adjusting / testing different settings in root `tsconfig.json`
- optimize `.d.ts` generation, switch to `rootDir` to have normalized directory names for merge-dir, not depending if anything is imported or not
    - currently intended to be defined in the package.json per package that should be generated
    - options like `composite`/`references` didn't work, except with a defined order of script execs, so most likely no option
    - a central tsgen command seems to be the easiest, which then merges the declaration files into each packages build
        - reducing type generations, only once per project
        - needs adjustments to not generate for apps like demo/docs
- remove slate/editorjs or migrate to basic react18 support
    - migrate from `@mui/styles`
    - upgrade peer deps to react18 support
