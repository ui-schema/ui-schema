# New Array Validator

This report details the significant update to the array validator. The new implementation enhances compliance with JSON Schema specifications, improves accuracy, and provides more detailed error reporting. It replaces the previous validator with a more robust, maintainable, and predictable engine.

## Key Change

The previous validator was a complex mix of functions with overlapping responsibilities, leading to inconsistent behavior and difficulty in maintenance. The new validator adopts a more streamlined and spec-compliant approach:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Logic is now broken down into smaller, focused functions (`validateUniqueItems`, `validateContains`, `validateItems`), each handling a specific set of JSON Schema keywords.
- **Unified Schema Normalization:** A new `normalizeArraySchema` function internally translates different JSON Schema draft conventions (`items`/`additionalItems` vs. `prefixItems`/`items`) into a single, consistent model for validation. This makes the validator's behavior predictable regardless of the schema style used.

## Comparison of Rules: Previous vs. New

### `items`, `additionalItems`, and `prefixItems` (Tuple/List Validation)

**Previous Behavior:**
The old validator manually handled tuple validation (`items` as an array) and list validation (`items` as an object) in a monolithic function (`validateArrayContent`). This led to several issues:

- It conflated tuple validation with recursive validation, making it hard to control.
- `additionalItems` logic was complex and applied inconsistently.
- It had no concept of the modern `prefixItems` keyword, attempting to simulate its behavior with the older `items` array syntax.
- Error reporting for invalid items was often imprecise, with errors sometimes attached to the parent array instead of the specific invalid item.

**New Behavior:**
The new `validateItems` function provides a single, unified implementation for all item validation:

- **Draft 2020-12+ Support:** It correctly interprets `prefixItems` for tuple validation and `items` for the schema of all subsequent items.
- **Backward Compatibility:** It correctly interprets the Draft-07 style where `items` is an array for tuple validation and `additionalItems` defines the schema for subsequent items.
- **`items: false`:** The rule `items: false` (or `additionalItems: false`) is now correctly enforced, generating an `ERROR_ADDITIONAL_ITEMS` for any item that violates it.
- **Pinpoint Error Location:** Errors are now correctly attributed. For example, if the third item in an array `['a', 'b', 123]` fails a `{ "type": "string" }` check, the error's `instanceLocation` will be `/2`.

### `contains`

**Previous Behavior:**
The old `validateContains` implementation had several flaws:

- It would pollute the main error output with validation errors from *every* item that didn't match the `contains` schema, even when a valid item was found.
- The logic for `minContains` and `maxContains` was complex and hard to follow.
- Handling of empty arrays was not robust, leading to incorrect `NOT_FOUND_CONTAINS` errors in some edge cases.

**New Behavior:**
The new `validateContains` is far more precise:

- **Silent Sub-Validation:** It uses a helper (`validateItemsAgainstSchema`) to check how many items match the `contains` schema *without* adding their validation errors to the main output. This is the correct behavior, as `contains` only cares about the *count* of valid items.
- **Clear `minContains` Logic:** It correctly defaults `minContains` to `1` if the keyword is not present. It issues a clear `ERROR_NOT_FOUND_CONTAINS` if this default is not met, and `ERROR_MIN_CONTAINS` if an explicit `minContains` is not met.
- **Improved Error Context:** Errors now include the `found` count alongside the required `minContains` or `maxContains`, making debugging easier.

### `uniqueItems`

**Previous Behavior:**
The old `validateUniqueItems` returned a simple boolean, and the main validator added a generic `ERROR_DUPLICATE_ITEMS` error if it was `false`. This gave no information about *what* was duplicated.

**New Behavior:**
The new `validateUniqueItems` is much more informative:

- **Detailed Duplicate Information:** When duplicates are found, the error context now includes a `duplicates` array. Each entry specifies the duplicate `value` and an array of `indexes` where it was found. This is invaluable for debugging user input.

## Incompatible and Breaking Changes

- **Removal of `validateArrayContent`:** This internal function has been removed. Its logic is now cleanly integrated into the new `validateItems` function.
- **Stricter Error Reporting:** Errors are now more specific. For instance, the old validator might have produced a generic `WRONG_TYPE` error for an entire array that was supposed to be a tuple. The new validator will instead fail the specific items within the array that have the wrong type, or report `ERROR_ADDITIONAL_ITEMS` if too many items are present.
- **Correct `contains` Default:** The `contains` keyword now correctly implies a `minContains` of `1` as per the JSON Schema specification. Schemas that relied on the old, buggier behavior (where `contains` could pass on an empty array) will now fail validation as expected.
- **Instance Pointers:** Error `instanceLocation` pointers are now more accurate, pointing to the specific index of the invalid item (e.g., `/3`) rather than just the parent array.

## Newly Supported Keywords

- **`prefixItems` (JSON Schema Draft 2020-12):** The validator now fully supports `prefixItems` for defining tuples. This is the modern standard, and its adoption allows for clearer and more expressive schemas. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "array",
    "prefixItems": [
      { "type": "string" },
      { "type": "number" }
    ],
    "items": { "type": "boolean" }
  }
  ```
  This schema validates arrays like `["hello", 123, true, false]` but rejects `[123, "hello"]`.

## Fixes and Other New Features

- **Improved Error Context:**
    - `uniqueItems` errors now report *which* values are duplicates and at *which* indices.
    - `contains` errors now report the `found` number of items vs. the required `minContains` or `maxContains`.
- **Robust `items: false` Handling:** This now works correctly for both homogeneous arrays and in conjunction with `prefixItems` to disallow additional items.
- **Code Quality:** The entire validator has been refactored for readability, maintainability, and testability, reducing the likelihood of future bugs.
- **Predictable Behavior:** By normalizing different schema styles into one internal model, the validator behaves consistently across all supported JSON Schema drafts.
