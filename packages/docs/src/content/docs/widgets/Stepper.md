# Stepper / Sequential

A stepper is a widget that renders a sub-schema after another, it is only possible to enter the next if the current is validated.

- each property/sub-schema of a stepper is used as a step
- validation of whole stepper is completed after all steps have been rendered
- creates an object out of all
- the stepper controls it's own `showValidity`, this overwrites an existing `false` to `true`
  - this highlights only the invalid of the stepper, not the containing schema
  - if the containing schema should display validity, the stepper will do it also
  - it reset's it's own `showValidity` on switching steps
- type: `object`
- widget keywords:
    - `Stepper` for the root object containing steps
- view
    - grid keywords
