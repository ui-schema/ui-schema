# Grid Handler

These components are the wire/grid in which the widgets are rendered.

- `RootRenderer`, defined as special widget: `widgets.RootRenderer`
    - the first component that is rendered for the editor, containing the root-level
    - not applied for `NestedSchemaEditor`, this starts directly at schema-level
- `GroupRenderer`, defined as special widget: `widgets.GroupRenderer`
    - has the GridHandler as children
    - each native-object is wrapped with this (default), each property of an `object` results in a new child
- `GridHandler`, plugin in the pluginStack, you should not need to configure/add it
    - view
        - [View Keywords](/docs/schema#view-keyword)
    - if the prop `noGrid` is passed through the stack, the grid item is not rendered
    - added to the widget-stack
        - thus each widget is automatically wrapped with the needed grid handler to build responsive grid
        
Disabling the GridHandler with `noGrid` can - for example - be done by passing it down from `NestedSchemaEditor`:

```js
<NestedSchemaEditor
    showValidity={showValidity}
    storeKeys={storeKeys.push(i)}
    schema={schema.get('items')}
    noGrid
/>
```

## Design System

### Material-UI

```js
import {
    RootRenderer, GroupRenderer,
    /* not needed to add, is registered in `pluginStack` 
        SchemaGridHandler, SchemaGridItem, 
    */
} from "@ui-schema/ds-material/Grid";
import {pluginStack} from "@ui-schema/ds-material/pluginStack";
import {validators} from "@ui-schema/ui-schema/Validators/validators";

const widgets = {
    RootRenderer,
    GroupRenderer,
    validators,
    pluginStack:pluginStack,
    types: {},
    custom: {},
};

export {widgets};
```

Components:

- `SchemaGridHandler` plugin compatible component, should exist in the widget-stack
- `SchemaGridItem` the actual widget that is capable of parsing the schema into `n columns width when window size is y`
