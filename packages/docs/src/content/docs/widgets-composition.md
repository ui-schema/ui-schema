# Concepts & Widgets Composition

This page contains more in-depth docs and thoughts about the [widgets](/docs/widgets) composition and core concepts - which enable near endless widget & plugins customization, powered by `@ui-schema/ui-schema`.

## Deep Dive Concepts

"Basic concepts" to get a better understanding of what's going on in the core:

Built with the ReactJS native [render flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#the-data-flows-down) and [hoisted states](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html#lifting-state-up) as foundation, leaning a few principles from [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow) / [`flux`](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview).

Rendering [atomic conditional](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) and [pure](https://medium.com/technofunnel/working-with-react-pure-components-166ded26ae48) wrapper components around single schema levels. Forming a [typical AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) by the [happy path according to schema & data](#happy-path).

A lot of [component composition](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition) by the `WidgetEngine`, around `WidgetOverride` or/and the [`binding`, especially `.widgets`](/docs/widgets#create-design-system-binding) to get / specify the needed custom react components for each usage, thus there is [no HTML-output inside the core](#output-in-core).

Custom [`React.Context` / Providers](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) are used for handling store updates and extracting with special [HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (connecting `store` to `props`), but enabling `store`/`state` management by typical stuff like `React.useState`, `React.useReducer` or redux reducers.

Using an additional [plugins system based on props](/docs/react/widgetengine#simple-plugins) for a shallower component tree of e.g. validators.

## Widgets & Component Plugins

Each plugin or widget should only need to do one specific thing, in one specific schema layer, leading to [enhanced performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#shouldcomponentupdate-in-action) and optimizing [reconciliation levels](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html). The values are stored in a central [immutable data-structure](/docs/react/store), accessible per schema-level by the schema-position with `storeKeys` (a list of the keys (`string|number`)), the `storeKeys` need to be passed down in nested components (e.g. `object`).

> Check the base concepts about [performance](/docs/performance) to learn how unnecessary re-renders are reduced.

The AST and plugins are rendered by [`WidgetEngine`](/docs/react/widgetengine).

A plugin or widget can use more than only it's own schema/store level in various ways.

- `ObjectRenderer` uses one schema-level, to build the next level automatically, by nesting of `WidgetEngine`
- *(deprecated in 0.5.x)* the `UIApi`/`ReferencingNetworkHandler` components use [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to connect to `UIApiProvider` from within the plugin component.

## Rendering Basics

Special entry point components start the UI Rendering, connecting to and/or creating some contexts & providers and/or relying on given props to do something, according to their definite position in `schema` and data (`storeKeys`).

See [flowchart of @ui-schema/ui-schema](/docs/core#flowchart), textual example: `UIMetaProvider` > `UIStoreProvider` > `WidgetEngine` > (optional `binding.ErrorFallback` >) `binding.widgetPlugins` (including `SchemaPluginsAdapter` with validator plugin) > `binding.WidgetRenderer` > widget matching > actual `Widget`.

### Happy Path

In `@ui-schema`, the **validator and render engine** transforms a JSON Schema into an interactive UI. This is done automatically ‚Äî by interpreting schema definitions into input components and rendering logic. This process works best when schemas are written to follow a predictable, declarative structure ‚Äî this is what we call the **"happy path."**

> A happy path schema makes it easy for the renderer to answer:
>
> **"What inputs should exist, and how should the user interact with them?"**

#### From Schema to UI: Rendering vs. Validation

While traditional JSON Schema **validators** only need to evaluate a schema *against existing data*, a UI renderer like `@ui-schema` must go further.

It needs to explore:

- What fields **could** exist at the current state?
- Where does each field reside within the overall object tree?
- Which subschemas are **eligible to render** now, based on schema logic and current data?
- What overlapping definitions (e.g., shared properties across multiple `allOf` branches) must be **merged or deduplicated**?

To support this, `@ui-schema` uses two complementary strategies:

##### Depth-First Traversal

The engine recursively walks the schema tree:

- From the root object down through nested objects, arrays, combination and conditional sub-schemas
- Using validation results, when available, to decide which branches to follow
- Treating the schema as an **abstract syntax tree (AST)** ‚Äî a stable and declarative source of truth, whether or not data exists
- Ensuring that rendering remains **predictable** even in the absence of data
- Binding UI state (e.g., validation, defaults, errors) along the way

This traversal ensures:

- Deeply nested fields are rendered consistently and in the correct hierarchy
- UI state is scoped to the correct data paths
- Custom widgets and logic can attach precisely to their intended positions in the schema

##### Look-Ahead Evaluation

Unlike validators, the renderer must also consider what **could** exist ‚Äî not just what‚Äôs currently present in the data.

- For schema constructs like `if/then/else`, `oneOf`, or `anyOf`, it may **preload or prepare** UI for multiple potential branches
- For nested objects and optional fields, it must **suggest or show** properties that are not yet in the data
- This **forward-looking behavior** is essential for interactive UIs that guide users through available inputs

In short: validators can afford to be reactive ‚Äî but UI renderers must be **proactive**. They need to make decisions about *possibilities*, not just *presence*, all while keeping behavior **predictable and schema-driven**.

#### Why Not Everything Can Be Automatic

Despite `@ui-schema`'s advanced inference, some JSON Schemas are either too ambiguous or too complex to render automatically.

This includes cases like:

- ‚ùå [Illogical schemas](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining.html#illogicalschemas) ‚Äî where combining keywords contradict each other (e.g. `type: "string"` and `properties`)
- ‚ùì [Subschema independence](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#rfc.section.11.1) ‚Äî where subschemas in `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf` don't compose meaningfully
- üåÄ Overly dynamic schemas ‚Äî e.g., `array` schemas allowing multiple types or deeply nested combinations

In these cases, you may need to:

- Write **custom widgets**
- Use **custom plugins** for rendering logic
- Use **custom validators** to produce `applied` schema
- Or re-structure the schema to provide a predictable "happy path"

#### Best Practices for the Happy Path

To stay on the happy path:

- Structure schemas **declaratively** (one `type`, predictable `properties`)
- Avoid deeply nested `oneOf` unless you can clearly control selection
- Use `widget` and plugin-based enhancements to guide the renderer
- Think in terms of **Schema as Behavior Blueprint**
- Think of JSON Schema not just as a validator ‚Äî but as a blueprint for UI behavior and layout.
- The schema defines what can exist, and the UI must infer how it could appear ‚Äî regardless of current data state.
- This blueprint must be possible to reduce to concrete rendering decisions at each schema level: what widgets to show, what fields to expand, and what interactions to offer.

##### Summary

| Engine Role      | JSON Schema Validator      | `@ui-schema` UI Renderer               |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Purpose          | Validate existing data     | Render what could be input             |
| Strategy         | Reactive                   | Proactive (look-ahead)                 |
| Missing fields   | Ignored unless required    | May be shown for interaction           |
| Schema traversal | Shallow or conditional     | Depth-first, full expansion            |
| Branch logic     | Evaluated on data presence | Pre-rendered or conditionally rendered |

By understanding the happy path and the **depth-first / look-ahead** nature of UI schema rendering, you‚Äôll be able to craft schemas that are not just valid ‚Äî but also powerful, dynamic, and highly usable.

#### Example for subschema independence

- multiple `anyOf` should evaluate either one or another schema
- but what UI should be rendered?
- this can only be assumed by existing data
    - but not always, not fully reliable
- a custom `widget` that supports "user can select which one", can handle those schemas correctly
    - *todo:* there isn't a `anyOf` validator atm.

#### Example for multiple types

- the widget matching must resolve to a specific `native-type` (or be overwritten with a custom `widget`)
- validation can support multiple types, e.g. as it only must validate `type: string` when the value is of type `string`
- for `"type": "string"` exactly one widget can match
- for `"type": "null"` exactly one widget can match
- for `"type": ["string", "null"]` multiple widgets may match
    - but for this special use case, it does infer to render `string`, as `null` doesn't have an input use case
- for `"type": ["string", "number", "null"]` multiple widgets may match
    - and it could not determine what to render exactly, when no data exists
    - this must be handled with a custom `"widget": "StringOrNumber"` which e.g. allows selecting if a `string` or `number` can be entered
    - since `0.5.x` the matcher removes `null`, orders multiple types and joins them with a `+`, to make it easier to define suitable widgets
        - `"type": ["string", "number", "null"]` becomes `number+string`
        - `"type": ["string", "boolean", "number"]` becomes `boolean+number+string`
        - check the [test file of `schemaTypeToDistinct`](https://github.com/ui-schema/ui-schema/blob/6b013875f655e845ffe82d86fbb51eafd7d5770f/packages/ui-schema/src/schemaTypeToDistinct/schemaTypeToDistinct.test.ts) for more examples

Together with cases like: `deleteOnEmpty` within `array` [issue #106](https://github.com/ui-schema/ui-schema/issues/106), the happy-path also influences what data store updates really do.

### Output in Core

With v0.5.x the `@ui-schema/ui-schema` package is isomorphic and not responsible to produce anything itself.

The new "rendering core" `@ui-schema/react` has no hard coded output, only headless components and hooks are required to get it working.

Output only exists in two **optional components**:

- `@ui-schema/react`
    - if no widget could be matched, the `NoWidget` is rendered by `WidgetRenderer`
        - caused by error which is emitted by `matchWidget`
        - can be changed with a custom `NoWidget` component in the `binding`
        - renders an empty fragment with `missing-*` text when no widget is matching
    - *(deprecated in 0.5.x)* loading info in `Plugins/ReferencingHandler` while missing schemas are loaded AND it is not virtual
        - the `Translate` component is rendered with `labels.loading` and with fallback text `Loading`
